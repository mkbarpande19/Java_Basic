Here’s a comprehensive list of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** categorized by their types. This list includes fundamental algorithms and techniques that are widely used in computer science and software engineering:

### **1. Sorting Algorithms:**
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.

1. **Bubble Sort** - A simple comparison-based algorithm where adjacent elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort** - Finds the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3. **Insertion Sort** - Builds the sorted array one element at a time, by inserting each element into its correct position.
4. **Merge Sort** - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and merges them.
5. **Quick Sort** - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array around the pivot.
